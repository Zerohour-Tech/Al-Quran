1. [Quran](https://quran.com/)
2. [Sunnah](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/1)
3. Asbab ul Nuzul - [Al Wahidi](https://www.altafsir.com/Books/Asbab%20Al-Nuzul%20by%20Al-Wahidi.pdf) 

## Why? 
This is all from Quran.com, so none of this is my own work. I love what they are doing, the accessibility and affordance is absolutely brilliant. 

The only addition I intend to make here is put this in a public modifiable format i.e. an obsidian vault, such that it can be used to make sense of the whole, such that it can be used to understand it. 

[My master's thesis](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/995091/) was on academic reading. And at the heart of academic reading is reading for learning.
A text to be read must also be a text to write. When we read we don't just passively absorb material, reading is an active process. And so to support that for myself I made this here. It may be useful for someone else as well. 

The main branch is just converting it into this format. 
My own analysis and thinking will either be in a separate branch or I wont publish it at all. :) 

Hope this helps anyone who visits it.
